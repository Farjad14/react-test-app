## Starting the app (SSR & CSR)
- yarn run dev - It will build and start the app in SSR mode (SEO Friendly)

## Use of Local Storage
- Storing the list of items on local storage, by keeping a dummy content, so if user deletes the user storage completely it will add the dummy content back in

## CSS Framework
- Use of React Emotion Library

## React Intl
- Use of FormatJs, using Formatted Messages for English/French locale. I have not added french messages yet however.

## Storybook
